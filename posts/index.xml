      <description>Over the last 10 years, I had interviewed around 400 candidates for software positions, while working at Microsoft, Facebook (now Meta), and UiPath. There are 3 main types of interviews and it is quite surprising how similar are the interviews across the industry :
 Coding: does the candidate manage to successfully, end2end solve an algorithmic problem with decent code? Behavior: try to project if the candidate will work well in the team/organization/company.</description>

      <description>I love to learn new things, in part because I want to explore my next-self, in part standard curiosity. When it comes to learning or in general consuming optimally content to achieve a goal I see a gradient between visual people and audio-minded folks. In my case I&amp;rsquo;m definitely on the audio side, with learning/exploration paradigm being somewhere between audiobook and podcast, spending a good amount of time on books, some of the more relevant I put on my good reads which for me should be more like GoodListens since most of the title I consumed in the audio format while doing normal living stuff : drive, doing sports, dishes.</description>
