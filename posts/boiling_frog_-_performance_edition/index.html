But it is indeed a good mental model to warn us about dangers of gradual failure and people lack of reaction of slowly creeping in issues.\nI like to think about my self as being rational and not fail for this inability to spot slow trends. Well it is not true, I totally implemented a boiling frog in the context of my dev machine:\nWhen it was new, all was blazingly fast, naturally had somewhat good amount of ram, fresh processor, bells and whistles. Then I start to see how it starts to work, slower. Maybe I installed too many programs, maybe I should remove the virtual machines, Action 1: Uninstall Docker and VM, disable virtualizations from BIOS, who knows maybe a laptop is not meant for virtualization. The system looks working slightly better. In hindsight - this is me suffering from a variation of confirmation bias (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_perception) Action 2: Disabling virtualization help somewhat but not yet at right performance (measured subjectively) so next step playing with system performance. I observed the system show increase clock speed when the performance was degraded, so the fix was disable turbo bust. Action 3 : disable external graphic card - for sure that was not helping the system. Action 4: Disable turbo bust helped, but the system still struggled and I now observed that it suffered from sudden CPU frequency decreasing to 0.8 Ghz, well bellow the 2.3 GHz nominal speed. Next step go with system to configure extreme performance mode for the cooler. My poor machine sounds like a plane ready to take off, but the performance was stable Well, this summer I started to see again degradation of performance and thermal throttling, even with the maximum fan speed. Here is when I become intimate friend with tools to monitor the temperature and frequency of the CPU. It looks my CPU was standardly gets to 80 degrees C, and stay there without big stress. Maybe was my dev setup and having a SQL Server running SO, enough is enough! my performance minded engineering woke up and come with a hypothesis, a rather natural one: what if my cooling paste was failing . I knew originally my system should have use the fancy “thermal grizzly cooling paste”. Good thought and researching it actually a real thing - this paste does degrades and dries over time, exactly my experience.\nSo get myself equipped with an alternative long lasting, slightly less conductive thermal paste I opened my laptop I remove loads of stuff from my fans, which by itself was enough to make it poorly performance I was ready to face ultimate evil - the dry thermal paste, when, looking at the heat sync it was - dry, completely dry and clean. Not ever touched by paste. Both the CPU, GPU and the heat sync were clean as a whistle. Oh how much emotions did I feel for my beloved Dell !!! What the heck ! Of course the poor computer would suffer, and the gradual degradation was just the fan getting clogged with detritus and stuff In the end, with a little of paste, now the computer stays 60-70 degrees C even when I stress it with online CPU tests (https://cpux.net/cpu-benchmark-online), next step: put back turbo boost, virtualization, external GPU, reduce the fan so I can concentrate while using the box.
